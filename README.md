# ansible-chip-roles
This repository is to store the different ansible configuration/roles that I make


# /postactive/
postActive is a GNUSocial fork with more recent updates.
For this configuration you will need to download the tar.gz file from the postactive git at: https://git.postactiv.com/postActiv/postActiv and place it within the files folder, and if it's a different commit you will need to change the extracted folder name within the configuration too.


# /gnufm/
GnuFM is an audioscrobbling service like Last.FM and is the backend to Libre.FM
The setup defaults to `2014` which is a direct copy of Libre.FM's theme. You can easily change and make your own theme if you wish.

# /ansiblechip/
This folder is setup to install ansible on another system and a script to generate a URL list of the currently installed packages.
