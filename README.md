# ansible-chip-roles
This repository is to store the different ansible configuration/roles that I make


# /postactive/
postActive is a GNUSocial fork with more recent updates.
For this configuration you will need to download the tar.gz file from the postactive git at: https://git.postactiv.com/postActiv/postActiv and place it within the files folder, and if it's a different commit you will need to change the extracted folder name within the configuration too.
